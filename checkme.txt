problem is probably with mongo, restore to connect and remove the database volume/check its permissions
when finished empty the mongo directory
copy the /tmp/doudou into the volume mounted to johnbtc#done
make a copy of johnbtc must be empty 
add to the dockerfile copying the wallet to .bitcoin/regtest

not working
